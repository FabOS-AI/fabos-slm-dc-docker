# Ansible Collection - fabos.docker

The collection provides playbooks for installing and uninstalling of docker on a target host (see "setup" role) and 
deploying and undeploying of container based on docker-compose files (see "use" role). The additional "inventory_helper"
role helps to create an inventory in the context of the FabOS Service Lifecycle Management (SLM).
